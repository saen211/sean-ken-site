# Sean Kennedy's Website
This is the repo for my personal website, this site will include:<br />
<In Progress> 1.) Barebones using HTML and Bootstrap<br />
<To-Do> 2.) Set up styles using CSS and make it look pretty<br />
<To-Do> 3.) Using React.js and other stuff, link pages for my experience and resume<br />
<To-Do> 4.) Somehow include Angular.js to learn how to use it for future use<br />
<br />
Long Term goals:<br />
<To-Do> 1.) Use MongoDB and other stuff just for the heck of learning it, Why? Why not.<br />
<To-Do> 2.) Make Faux sites for more experience in web design for examples<br />
<To-Do> 3.) Link any project I work on in the future, if possible, make a demo on the site.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll add on to this as I work more on it, this is my first true repo so it'll get some taking use to, but hopefully all works out well.
