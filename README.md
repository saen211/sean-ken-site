# sean-ken-site
This is the repo for my personal website, this site will include:
<In Progress> 1.) Barebones using HTML and Bootstrap
<To-Do> 2.) Set up styles using CSS and make it look pretty
<To-Do> 3.) Using React.js and other stuff, link pages for my experience and resume
<To-Do> 4.) Somehow include Angular.js to learn how to use it for future use

Long Term goals:
<To-Do> 1.) Use MongoDB and other stuff just for the heck of learning it, Why? Why not.
<To-Do> 2.) Make Faux sites for more experience in web design for examples
<To-Do> 3.) Link any project I work on in the future, if possible, make a demo on the site.


I'll add on to this as I work more on it, this is my first true repo so it'll get some taking use to, but hopefully all works out well.
